## What a Caching System Is

A caching system temporarily stores data for quick access. It keeps frequently accessed data in a location where it can be retrieved more quickly than from the original source, improving performance and efficiency.

## What FIFO Means

**FIFO (First In, First Out)** is a caching algorithm where the oldest cached data is the first to be replaced when new data needs to be cached. This ensures that the cache evicts the data that has been stored the longest.

## What LIFO Means

**LIFO (Last In, First Out)** is a caching algorithm where the most recently cached data is the first to be replaced when new data needs to be cached. This approach treats the cache like a stack.

## What LRU Means

**LRU (Least Recently Used)** is a caching algorithm that removes the least recently accessed data first when the cache is full. This helps in keeping the most actively used data in the cache.

## What MRU Means

**MRU (Most Recently Used)** is a caching algorithm that removes the most recently accessed data first when the cache is full. This can be useful in certain scenarios where the most recently used data is least likely to be needed again soon.

## What LFU Means

**LFU (Least Frequently Used)** is a caching algorithm that removes the least frequently accessed data first. This approach ensures that the cache retains data that is accessed more often.

## Purpose of a Caching System

The purpose of a caching system is to reduce the time and resources needed to access frequently used data. It improves the performance of applications by decreasing the load on the main data source and speeding up data retrieval.

## Limits of a Caching System

Caching systems have limitations such as cache size (finite storage), cache coherence (keeping cached data up to date with the original source), eviction policies (determining what data to remove when the cache is full), and potential complexity in managing cache layers.
